## Welcome to my GitHub Page!
### Version: 1.0

Here you'll find my current (public) projects that are published to GitHub as well as a short description about them and status.
If you're looking for my main page (where I actually did all the code myself), you can find it [here](https://web.kraxarn.com)

## Bank
### Alpha [(repo)](https://github.com/kraxarn/Bank)
A virtual bank app useful for games where you have the fake money. Designed for Monopoly in mind, but works with other games of course. Currently in alpha since most features aren't working yet.

## KraxbotOSS
### Ongoing [(repo)](https://github.com/kraxarn/KraxbotOSS)
Open source and cross platform for managing Steam chatrooms. Also supports sending messages to and from a Discord channel. Finished, but receives updates from time to time. A 2.0 update is planned though, with a mostly complete rewrite with added support for multiple user interfaces. That way we don't need to use WinForms for all platforms and actually make it look good. Stay tuned.

## CrowEngine
### Planned (no repo yet)
The public version of my 2D game engine. Currently making some changes to make it easier to port to other platforms and such before I make a repo for it, but stay tuned.
